              I love working with computer logic, and as such enjoy working with client-side frameworks such as Backbone, Angular and (especially) React.  I have built out several servers in Node.js and Express and also enjoy wiring the client and server together.  I have also worked with Unity3D in C# to build out a local multiplayer computer game with some friends.  I completed Hack Reactor in 2015 and was selected to be a Hacker in Residence. I also graduated from UC Berkeley in 2013 with a B.S. in Environmental Sciences.

              I enjoy boardgames, swing dancing, and I'm a sucker for a good story, be it a book, movie, or TV show (I'm a Clancy fan, and just started the Song of Ice and Fire series).  I've worked in the sewers, a refrigerator, and the snow and believe that everything in life is an opportunity for adventure.

              I also have a penchant for adventure sports such as the Goruck Challenge and Tough Mudder.  While a lot of people would consider throwing 6 bricks in a backpack and getting run around SF for 13 hours in the dead of night insane, I thought it sounded like a grand time (and have done 2).  I love a good challenge and will tackle anything that is thrown my way.
